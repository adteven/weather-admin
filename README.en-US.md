**English** | [中文](./README.md)

## Introduce

The simplified version is based on the shelf extracted from [weather-admin](https://github.com/adteven/weather-admin.git), which contains main functions and is more suitable for actual project development. The packaged size is introduced globally [element-plus](https://element-plus.org) is still below `2.3MB`, and the full version of the code will be permanently synchronized. After enabling `brotli` compression and `cdn` to replace the local library mode, the package size is less than `350kb`

## Usage

### Installation dependencies

pnpm install

### Install a package

pnpm add packageName

### Uninstall a package

pnpm remove packageName

I think you should fork the project first to develop, so that you can pull the update synchronously when I update! ! !
